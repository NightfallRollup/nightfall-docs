# Browser Wallet

Nightfall invluides a brwoser wallet as an alternative client for a user to perform transactions.
With the brower wallet, a user is able to generate ZKP without relying on the `Client` trusted server.

Wallet code can be found [here](https://github.com/EYBlockchain/nightfall_3/tree/master/wallet).
